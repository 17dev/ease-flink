```python
from typing import List
from .pipeline import Pipeline

class Workflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipelines = []

    def add_pipeline(self, pipeline: Pipeline):
        self.pipelines.append(pipeline)

    def run(self):
        for pipeline in self.pipelines:
            pipeline.run()

    def get_pipeline_names(self) -> List[str]:
        return [pipeline.name for pipeline in self.pipelines]
```

This code defines a `Workflow` class that allows you to create and run multiple pipelines. The `Workflow` class has the following methods:

- `__init__()`: Initializes an empty list of pipelines.
- `add_pipeline(pipeline)`: Adds a pipeline to the workflow.
- `run()`: Runs all the pipelines in the workflow.
- `get_pipeline_names()`: Returns a list of names of all the pipelines in the workflow.
